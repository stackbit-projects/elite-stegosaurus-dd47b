> The next geopolitical tussle between technologically advanced states will be the race to set technical standards in critical and emerging technologies.  What should India’s approach be?

## Summary  

Technical standards have historically been a private affair of big technology companies. An international technology standard helps to gain an economic and technological advantage over any competitors forcing the rest to follow a particular way of designing the technology.  But in recent times, a steady increase in the presence of governments’ participation has been observed in the process of standards-setting. States are now openly advocating for certain standards to be adopted as the global ones which would eventually benefit the state itself. A company situated on their soil and owning a global standard in a critical technology would mean the control of said technology supply chain.


## Our Approach

International technical standards have the possibility of changing the economic and technological domain of critical technologies. We, at Takshashila, believe that India should pose itself in a way that it does not bear the brunt of this geopolitical tussle and ensure that it ups the game in influencing and setting international technical standards in the future.

The eventual decline of the dominance of the West in the standards domain offers an opportunity for India to play a bigger role in finalising and setting technology standards. But firstly, there is a need for the country to work towards strengthening the technology sector. At the same time, there is also a need for diplomats and foreign policy experts to understand the leverage that critical technologies hold in shaping the global economy. Finding a common ground between the two will help India play an active role in advocating for an international technical standard that can boost its domestic economic growth as well as project geopolitical influence.
