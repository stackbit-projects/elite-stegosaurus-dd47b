> Digital Communication Networks are deeply intertwined in several aspects of our lives. How can we govern them in ways that maximise the benefits and minimise the harms?

## Summary
Digital Communication Networks play an infrastructural role in public discourse and private communication. Though societies have successfully governed transformative technologies in the past, the pace and scale of changes enabled by DCNs are unprecedented. The Takshashila Institution believes that India needs to understand these changes and govern DCNs to maximise the surpluses they bring to Indian society while limiting the vulnerabilities they enable/exacerbate.
 
## Defining Digital Communication Networks

We define Digital Communication Networks (DCNs) as composite entities consisting of:
-   Capability: Internet-based products/services that enable instantaneous low-cost or free communication across geographic, social, and cultural boundaries. This communication may be private (1:1), limited (1:n e.g. messaging groups), or broad (Twitter feeds, Facebook pages, YouTube videos, live streaming ), and so on.
-   Operator(s): Firms/groups that design/operate these products and services.
-   Networks: The entities/groups/individuals that adopt/use these products and services, and their interactions with each other.
    
## Our Approach
Faced with the growing economic and political power of the firms that operate DCNs, nation-states are exploring/experimenting with various approaches to govern them. However, the precise set of problems/harms are not always clearly defined in local contexts. 

A significant portion of the analyses of the effects of DCNs has been undertaken in the context of a limited set of developed economies. A research agenda based on the effects in India is yet to be formulated even as it has amongst the largest user bases for many of these networks. With an estimated 795 million internet connections and an average connection density of 59 connections per 100 people, the headroom for penetration of DCNs and greater effects on Indian society remains high. 

Effective governance of Digital Communication Networks requires analysing their effects on societies as a whole, rather than focussing on specific companies, technologies, sharing mechanisms, user dynamics, and so onâ€” attributes that are constantly evolving. 

This will require understanding their role in the spheres of competition, data, and narratives in parallel. As well as accounting for local context, the prospect of the rapid exchange of global influences, possible overlaps, and contradictions across a wide range of proposed solutions.
